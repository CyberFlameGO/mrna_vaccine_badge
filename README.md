# mRNA vaccine badge

A small badge showing a schematic of an mRNA vaccine nanoparticle and blinking the RNA sequence of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. (Switch between vaccines by long pressing (>1s) the button to enter the menu, short pressing to switch, and long pressing to save).

The RNA for the moderna vaccine is from is from https://github.com/NAalytics/Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273 with an added poly-A tail of similar length to the Pfizer one (just a guess). The Pfizer sequence is from https://berthub.eu/articles/11889.doc

The sequences are stored encoded into 2 bits per nucleotide using [encode_genome.py](encode_genome.py).

Current draw is ~3mA depending on which color LEDs are active at the moment (the blue ones are a lot more efficient than the red ones), which should last over a day of continuous use on a CR2032 coin cell.
